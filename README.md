# Full_codes_and_files_for_turnning_in

a brief introduction is in the first few lines of system_gui.py, here's a copy

# READ THIS: before running this code, run chat_server.py first to make sure it's listening thus we can log in
# READ THIS: there are three amazing neural networks models, to let them work in full glory, please recognize on the
    # canvas inside the gui, as the canvas in the online demo is not as good as this one
# READ THIS: if you'd also like to try the online demo, please run app.py to load the webpage before hitting the button for online demo
# REMARK: the order of running files: first run chat_server.py (and app.py for optional webpage demo (unnecessary)), then run system_gui.py

# Credits: many credits due to nyush icds team and professors, many credits due to the three collaborators, namely,
    # justin, jenson and walter, some credits due to chatgpt.com for refining the codes for the neural network codes, but
    # in the other parts it was not helping too much and always causing troubles
# Thanks: Great thanks to nyush icds team and professors, and Michael Neilson's 2019 book, as cited in the presentation video
# Final remarks: this is a very interesting experience and chance, i've learnt a lot about many things.
    # thank you all: professors, teammates, online educators, writers, chatgpt.com, and me myself. I love you guys so much
